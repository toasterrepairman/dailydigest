# daily digest

*a personal project for fetching the day's info from Google and printing it*

## info

this is a tool in active development. I offer no guarantees for how well it works, and take no blame if you accidentally use it and it burns down your house or something of that ilk.

this script will be designed to work in conjunction with [the kitty printer](www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004063490847.html) that I saw on Hacker News the other day. maybe this will work! maybe it won't. time will tell.
